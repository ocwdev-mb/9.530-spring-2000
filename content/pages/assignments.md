The sample assignments below are designed to explore computation in the cellular-molecular realm. The first problem set explores how enzymes work in a biological system, and how the system can be reduced to mathematical equations that are useful for modeling. The second problem set illustrates how a biological system can be used to create an oscillating state.

Problem Set 1: Enzyme Kinetics ({{% resource_link a8aaf9fd-8653-593a-ab46-59e9653e12f3 "PDF" %}})
