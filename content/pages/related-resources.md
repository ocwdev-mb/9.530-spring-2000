The links below are online references for additional resources in the field of cellular and molecular computation. These range from professional societies that maintain links to areas that any reader can explore in this field. Many of the linked sites provide resources for further study, as well as downloadable resources that can be used for classroom teaching.

Neuroscience
------------

The [Society for Neuroscience](http://www.sfn.org/) addresses the study of brain development, sensation and perception, learning and memory, movement, sleep, stress, aging and neurological and psychiatric disorders. It also includes the molecules, cells and genes responsible for nervous system functioning.

The [International Brain Research Organization](http://ibro.info/) was founded to enhance the mobilization and utilization of the world's scientific resources for research on the brain.

The [National Institutes of Health](http://www.nih.gov/about/) (NIH) is the steward of medical and behavioral research for the United States, governed under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The [National Science Foundation](http://nsf.gov/) fosters the interchange of scientific information among scientists and engineers in the United States and foreign countries.

Molecular Biology/Protein Analysis
----------------------------------

[BLAST](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/){{< sup "®" >}} (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is a set of similarity search programs designed to explore all of the available sequence databases regardless of whether the query is protein or DNA.

The Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) [Search Launcher](http://www.xmarks.com/site/searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu/seq-util/seq-util.html) is an ongoing project to organize molecular biology-related search and analysis services available on the web by function, by providing a single point-of-entry for related searches.

[Pfam](http://pfam.xfam.org/) is a large collection of multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models covering many common protein families.

[Prodom](http://prodom.prabi.fr/prodom/current/html/home.php) is a comprehensive set of protein domain families automatically generated from the SWISS-PROT and TrEMBL sequence databases.

The [ExPASy](http://www.expasy.ch/) (Expert Protein Analysis System) proteomics server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics is dedicated to the analysis of protein sequences and structures.

The [Whitehead Institute](http://wi.mit.edu/) serves as the flagship of the Human Genome Project, the international effort to identify the blueprint for a human being.

Protocol
--------

[Bioprotocol](http://www.aboutus.org/BioProtocol.com) is a compendium of high quality web links of interest and use to life science researchers and others working in the areas of biotechnology and the biomedical sciences.

The [National Center for Research Resources](https://www.federallabs.org/labs/national-center-for-research-resources-ncrr) supports primary research to create and develop critical resources, models, and technologies.

Computation
-----------

Intelligence basically means the ability to perform well on new data after learning a model on the basis of given data. The [NATO Advanced Study Institute on Learning Theory and Practice](http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/sista/natoasi/ltp2002.html) conference promotes the understanding of problems of learning and generalization.

The [FoCM Workshop on Learning Theory](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/na/FoCM/index.html) supports and promotes research on foundations of computational mathematics. It fosters interaction among mathematics, computer science and other areas of computational science through its conferences, workshops and publications.

[Humanoids IEEE-RAS International Conference on Humanoid Robots](http://www.humanoids.ws/). This is an annual conference on recent developments in enabling technologies (processing power, mechatronics, walking machines, articulated vision heads and more), as well as findings and developments in other related fields (e.g., studies of the human brain, linguistics, psychology, and computation).

[MICCAI98](http://www.ai.mit.edu/conferences/miccai98/). International conference on medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention.

[Dynamics of Neural Networks: From Biophysics to Behavior, Institute for Theoretical Physics, UCSB 23 July - 22 December 2001.](http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/auto2/?id=3) This workshop was organized around three overlapping themes: perception and movement, learning and memory, and development.

[Dynamical Neuroscience IX: Timing, Persistence and Feedback Control, National Institute of Mental Health, November 9, 10, 2001](http://www.nimh.nih.gov/science-news/index.shtml). Exploration of the convergence of theoretical work and experimental data on neuronal computations that highlight the feedback requirement for the systematic operation of the nervous system. 

[Bell Laboratories](http://www.bell-labs.com/). For an in-depth look at research in neural networks, this site gives an excellent overview of some of the cutting-edge research that is happening today.
